This code is supposed to take in your devices location and output the Adhan timings and Qibla direction. 
Adhan, or Islamic Prayer timings are not a set time each day. 
Muslims pray 5 times a day, and the timings are determined by the placement of the sun in the sky. 
Qibla is the direction muslims must face when they pray, towards Mekkah, in Saudi Arabia.
